* How do you know if your system stops serving?
* How do you know if your system stops meeting it's external SLA?
* How do you know if your system is serving corrupt or inaccurate data?

## Monitoring

* How are you currently monitoring the application?
* How do you know if it goes down?
* What alerts do you currently receive?

## Logging

* How are logs collected?
* How are logs aggregated?
* Are all logs send to standard out?
