## Backing Services

This section is designed to explore what external services (DB, Cache, Mail, etc.) that need to be explored.

* Do you use: (and if so, which one and what version)
  * Database (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle)
  * Message/Queue system (e.g. Service Bus, Kafka)
  * SMTP
  * Cache (e.g. Redis)
  * Other API
* Can replace any instance above without a code change?
* Do you expect the DBA to keep the same role after the transition?
