# Microservice/Container Maturity Questionaire

## Background

Migrating an application to "The Cloud" or "Containers" provides numerous benefits for both application developers and operators.  However, this journey requires careful planning and preparation.

## Purpose

Because each application is a special snowflake, this document is designed to provide a starting point to reveal any challenges or "red flags" you might encounter before running in a containerized environment.

These are designed to askÂ probing questions to determine the application's maturity in migrating to containers, but could also be applied to any Cloud Native solution.

_NOTE: Many of these questions are inspired by: "12 Factor apps"._

## Benefit

* What benefit are you most interested in gaining from Microservices? (e.g. quicker deployments, easier scaling, etc.)

## Application Codebase

* What OS does the service run on?
* How do user's interact with the application?  (e.g. Browser, RDC, Run on Desktop, etc.)
* How are you storing your code?
  * e.g. VSTS, TFS, GitLab, etc.
  * This question is designed to underand how developers interact with their source code.  It can also be a leading indicator to their maturity model.  i.e. CVS is a red flag
* Do you have one repository per code base?
  * This question is to understand if the are able to build/deploiy their services separately.
* How do you deploy your services?
  * Follow up questions:
    * Do you deploy your UI separately from your API?
    * What are your deployment artifacts?
      * e.g. Java WAR, .EXE, Container
* What languages are used?

## Dependencies

* How do you declare your build dependencies?
  * e.g. Maven, config files
* How do you include your dependencies in your application?
  * e.g. Built into application artifact, deployed in separate build process

## Config

* How/where do you store your config?
* How do you generate your config?
* How do you update config on your application?
* Could you Open Source your application without exposing credentials?
  * Not asking if you plan to, but is just a litmus test

## Application Process

* Do the processes store any state?
* Do they need to support "sticky sessions"?
* Do they share anything with other processes?

## Service Exposure

* What ports are used?
* What ports are exposed externally?
  * Are these exposed to the public internet?
* How are ports declared?

## Concurrency

* Are there different process types?
  * e.g. Admin process, client, server, db migration, one-time scripts
  * How are they run?
* How do you scale processes?
  * Follow-up:  Can you scale processes independently?

## Disposability

* Can the processes be start/stopped on a moment's notice?
* What is the process start time?
* Are there background jobs?
  * Are the jobs re-enterant? (can be interrupted during exe and restarted safely)
  * Are the jobs idempotent?

## Culture

* Who is driving the initiative?
  * e.g. top-down (CTO), bottom-up (devs/ops), or both
  * For maximum effectiveness a company wide, not project specific approach, is recommended
  * However, it's recommended to start with a single project to develop confidence + competence
* How would you rate yourself from an automation perspective?
  * NOTE: If you rely on humans, you won't be able to scale.

## Conclusion

The keen observer will note that none of the questions above mentioned containers, but instead explored the process and standards which make for great containerized apps.
