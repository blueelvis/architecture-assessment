## Networking

* Any IPv4/IPv6 requirements?
* What is the expected traffic volume? traffic pattern?
* Does the application need to reach out to external services? (e.g. Database inside same Virtual Network, Authentication outside Virtual Network)
* How will users primarily connect with the application? (e.g. VPN, public internet, etc.)
* What Access Control Lists (ACL's) are required?  (e.g. whitelist by IP, Blacklist by IP)
* Is there any specific routing required? (e.g. All ingress/egress traffic must go through X)
