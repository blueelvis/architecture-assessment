# Architecture Assessments

This repo is designed to be a dumping ground of questions I've learned to ask when assessing a new software solution.

# Intent

When working with customers and partners, I need to be able to quickly vet their solution before we start discussing architecture or implementation.  These pages are designed to help me standardize questions I should ask so that all bases are covered.
