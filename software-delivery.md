# Software Delivery

## Automation
* How do you build your software? (e.g. Jenkins)
* How do you release your software? (e.g. Ansible)
* Are you implementing CI/CD?


## Validation
* How do you manage deployment errors?
* What are the pre/post launch validation plans?

## Configuration
* How do you deploy configuration files across environments?
* How do you deploy secret/sensitive files across environments?
* What distinct environments do you have? (e.g. Dev, test, stage, prod)
  * How do you deploy to each of the environments?
* What user does your software run as?
* Do you gracefully drain off traffic when upgrading?

## Timing
* How long does a global rollout take?
* What is your release cycle? (e.g. 1/mo, every merged PR)

## Change Management

* Is there an approval system for change?
* How do you document production changes?
